## I Am Rickras
   My name is Rickson de Oliveira Viana.
   
   I'd say I've been developing games for about 8 months (at the time of this readme).
  
   
   I developed half of a project that I am very proud of and that one day I will finish called Project Slime, but I put it on hold due to the lack of time from my current job and college.

   I made this project with some friends to deepen my knowledge of Unity. This project helped me to understand that it is indeed possible to make games, I discovered my potential to do so through it.
So, with the aim of deepening my knowledge even further in games and creating a solid portfolio to acquire my first vacancy as a game programmer, I started the 20 Games Challenge.

## Project for 20 games challenge

### What is Challenge?
   The 20 Games Challenge is a fun way to gain confidence while learning to make video games.
   If you take a traditional art class, you might be asked to re-create a famous work. It might sound like a waste of time at first, but by copying a masterpiece, you will often gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals that you could gain by just “winging it.”

   Video games are one of the most complex art forms to date. Mastering the fundamentals of game development will take a lot of practice and patience. Many professional game developers will recommend making multiple small projects instead of starting with your “dream game.”

This challenge is my attempt to simplify the learning process for anyone who wants to start making their own video games
